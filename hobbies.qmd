The past few years, I've picked up different hobbies based on where I've lived and the activities available to me. However, my personal interests always revolved around sports and physical health. Through these different activities, I've made many core memories and lifelong friends.

In high school, I was the captain of the soccer and tennis team. The story of how I began tennis was a funny one. During my sophomore year, all members of the basketball team either had to participate in spring workouts or play a spring sport. To avoid spring workouts, I decided to try out for tennis because everyone made the team (sorry coach). During undergrad, I continued playing tennis and eventually became president of my school's club tennis team. 

Following undergrad, I moved to Newark, NJ for graduate school about the same time COVID-19 restrictions were beginning to loosen. At first, I didn't see much opportunity to play tennis in the city, so I transitioned to the local gym where I got a membership. My girlfriend joined me in my fitness journey and we created a journal on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arethaliftsmike/) documenting our fitness journey.

Most recently, I've rediscovered my joy for basketball through a mutual friend who introduced me to a small group of people who play every week in New York City's Chinatown. To me, a perfect weekend afternoon is playing basketball until your legs feel like they're falling off, then refueling with dumplings. As if this wasn't enough basketball, I formed a team with some members of this group to play in a weekly league, with some of our highlights shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmi4N6Jyhs&t=171s).

Besides sports (and math), I also enjoy cooking, playing video games, and finding good deals at the grocery store.
